BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our ecosystem of customers and partners has stepped up to help people and organizations in every country use technology to be resilient and transform during the most trying of circumstances. Amid rapid change we\u2019ve witnessed technology empower telehealth, remote manufacturing, and new ways of working from home and serving customers. These capabilities have relied on the public cloud, which is built on the investments we have made over time. We are living in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, which is being sharpened by rapid advances in distributed computing, ambient intelligence, and multidevice experiences. This means the places we go and the things we interact with will increasingly become digitized, creating new opportunities and new breakthroughs. In the next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Arti\ufb01cial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together with the Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. A person\u2019s experience with technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential. We o\ufb00er an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. ", "PART I Item 1 The Ambitions That Drive Us To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: \u2022 Reinvent productivity and business processes. \u2022 Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. \u2022 Create more personal computing. Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes At Microsoft, we\u2019re providing technology and resources to help our customers navigate a remote environment. We\u2019re seeing our family of products play key roles in the ways the world is continuing to work, learn, and connect. Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including O\ufb03ce, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together O\ufb03ce 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is enabling rapid digital transformation by giving people a single tool to chat, call, meet, and collaborate. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights powered by Microsoft 365. Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics to transform business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise. These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and management. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, rede\ufb01ning what they can expect from their business applications. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers. Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform In the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees, optimize their operations, engage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services. Partnering with organizations on their digital transformation during this period is one of our largest opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital transformation platform and partner of choice; their success is our success. Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in. Our cloud business bene\ufb01ts from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at signi\ufb01cantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. The Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while o\ufb00ering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely o\ufb00ers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans security, compliance, identity, and management, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. Azure Arc simpli\ufb01es governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Security, compliance, identity, and management underlie our entire tech stack. We o\ufb00er integrated, end-to-end capabilities to protect people and organizations. In April 2021, we entered into a de\ufb01nitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc., a cloud and AI software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience. The acquisition will build on our industryspecific cloud offerings. ", "PART I Item 1 We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh enables presence and shared experiences from anywhere through mixed reality applications. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads and experiences which we believe will shape the next era of computing. The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. Azure Synapse Analytics, a limitless analytics service, brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics for immediate business intelligence and machine learning needs. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a developer tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform. Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal by putting people at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more \ufb02uid ways of working and learning. The PC has been mission-critical across work, school, and life to sustain productivity in a remote everything world. Windows 10 serves the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with AI-\ufb01rst interfaces ranging from voiceactivated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and mixed reality experiences. Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising. In June 2021, Microsoft announced the next generation of Windows \u2013 Windows 11. Windows 11 builds on the strengths of productivity, versatility, and security on Windows 10 today and adds in new experiences that include powerful task switching tools like new snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops; new ways to stay connected through chat; the information you want at your \ufb01ngertips; and more. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the \u201cintelligent edge.\u201d Microsoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect your data, with built-in shopping tools designed to save you time and money. Organizational tools such as Collections, Vertical Tabs, and Immersive Reader help you make the most of your time while browsing, streaming, searching, sharing, and more. We are committed to designing and marketing \ufb01rst-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Book 3, Surface Laptop Go, Surface Go 2, Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 4, Surface Pro X, Surface Studio 2, and Surface Duo. To expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we pursue the expansive opportunity in the gaming industry. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played, including cloud gaming so players can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the March 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC, one of the largest, privately held game developers and publishers in the world. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 \ufb01rst- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft\u2019s game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. ", "PART I Item 1 Our Future Opportunity In a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations as software and cloud computing play a huge role across every industry and around the world. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: \u2022 Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another. \u2022 Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. \u2022 Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer\u2019s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication. \u2022 Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass , and more. \u2022 Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms. \u2022 Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment. and drive increased engagement with our services like Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category de\ufb01nitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, \ufb01nancial markets, and business practices, and continues to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. Refer to Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our \ufb01scal year 2021 \ufb01nancial results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that bene\ufb01t the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint. In January 2021, we announced that in \ufb01scal year 2020 we reduced Microsoft\u2019s carbon emissions by 586,683 metric tons. We purchased the removal of 1.3 million metric tons of carbon from 26 projects around the world. Furthermore, we shared a commitment to transparency by subjecting the data in our annual sustainability report to third-party review and to accountability by including progress on sustainability goals as a factor in determining executive pay. ", "PART I Item 1 The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. We also pledged a $50 million investment in AI for Earth to accelerate innovation by putting AI in the hands of those working to directly address sustainability challenges. We are committed to playing our part to help accelerate the world\u2019s transition to a more economically and environmentally sustainable future for us all. Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity Our future opportunity depends on reaching and empowering all communities, and we are committed to taking action to help address racial injustice and inequity. With signi\ufb01cant input from employees and leaders who are members of the Black and African American community, our senior leadership team and board of directors announced in June 2020 that we had developed a set of actions to help improve the lived experience at Microsoft and drive change in the communities in which we live and work. These e\ufb00orts include increasing our representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion by doubling the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025; evolving our ecosystem with our supply chain, banking partners, and partner ecosystem; and strengthening our communities by using data, technology, and partnerships to help address racial injustice and inequities of the Black and African American communities in the U.S. and improve the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their communities. Over the last year, we have collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and programs including: expanding our existing justice reform work with a \ufb01ve-year, $50 million sustained e\ufb00ort, expanding access to a\ufb00ordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities and key institutions that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support Black and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonpro\ufb01ts that provide critical services to Black and African American communities. We have more than doubled our percentage share of transaction volume with Black- and African American-owned \ufb01nancial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we have seen growth in our Black- and African American-owned supplier base and in Black- and African American-owned technology partners in the Microsoft Partner Network, and we launched the Black Channel Partner Alliance community to support partners onboarding to the Microsoft Cloud and to unlock partner benefits for co-selling with Microsoft. We acknowledge we have more work ahead of us to address racial injustice and inequity, and are applying many of the programs above to help other underrepresented communities. Investing in Digital Skills With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is helping to ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We announced in June 2020 that we are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly vital to many of the world\u2019s jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certi\ufb01cation opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn\u2019s Economic Graph. We also invested $20 million in key non-pro\ufb01t partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people from underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy. Over 42 million people across every continent have accessed free training through our skills initiative. The e\ufb00ort surpassed its initial goals and has been expanded with a new emphasis on connecting learners with jobs that help put their new training to use and connecting employers with skilled job seekers they might not find in traditional networks. ", "PART I Item 1 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain diverse, world-changing talent. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can do their best work \u2013 a place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As of June 30, 2021, we employed approximately 181,000 people on a full-time basis, 103,000 in the U.S. and 78,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 67,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 60,000 were in product research and development; 40,000 were in sales and marketing; and 14,000 were in general and administration. Certain of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft\u2019s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious - trying new things without fear of failure. We identi\ufb01ed four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish: \u2022 Obsessing over what matters to our customers. \u2022 Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do. \u2022 Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses. \u2022 Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us. Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. 88% of employees globally participated in our \ufb01scal year 2021 MS Poll engagement survey, which covers a variety of topics such as inclusion, pay and bene\ufb01ts, and learning and development. Throughout the \ufb01scal year, we also collect nearly 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During \ufb01scal year 2021, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing racial injustice. In addition to poll and pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding and exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support. Diversity and Inclusion At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a di\ufb00erent set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better we represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower. We strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance to be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, or who identify as LGBTQI+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2020 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including: \u2022 Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business. \u2022 Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). \u2022 Disability representation. ", "PART I Item 1 Total Rewards We develop dynamic, sustainable, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to do their best work. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. As part of our e\ufb00ort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, we expanded stock eligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. Pay Equity In our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.001 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our ten other largest employee geographies (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and United Kingdom) combined earn $1.000 for every $1.000 by men in these countries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellness and Safety Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees\u2019 well-being and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We made substantial modi\ufb01cations to employee travel policies and implemented o\ufb03ce closures so non-essential employees could work remotely. We continued to pay hourly service providers such as cleaning and reception sta\ufb00 who may have otherwise been furloughed.
