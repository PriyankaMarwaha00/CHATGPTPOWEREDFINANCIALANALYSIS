", "Markets and Distribution The Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2018, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 29% and 71%, respectively, of total net sales. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and di\ufb00erentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an e\ufb00ective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. The Company\u2019s retail stores are typically located at high-tra\ufb03c locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-tra\ufb03c locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high-quality customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Company\u2019s products and related solutions. The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice, service and training, and offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software and other accessories that complement the Company\u2019s products. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high-quality Apple \ufb01xtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise, integration and support services. The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes e\ufb00ective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products, services and programs to address the needs of education customers. The Company also supports mobile learning and real-time distribution of, and access to, education-related materials through iTunes U \u00ae, a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online. The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force, select third-party resellers and its retail and online stores. The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable segments. The Company\u2019s products are deployed in these markets because of their performance, productivity, ease-of-use and seamless integration into information technology environments. The Company\u2019s products are compatible with thousands of third-party business applications and services, and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in2018, 2017 and 2016. Competition The markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and other digital electronic devices. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. The Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results can be adversely a\ufb00ected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices. These markets are highly competitive and include many large, well-funded and experienced participants. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify signi\ufb01cantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Company\u2019s products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to o\ufb00er solutions that are more competitive than those they currently o\ufb00er. These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. ", "The Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have signi\ufb01cant resources and experience and have established service o\ufb00erings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company\u2019s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes. The Company believes it o\ufb00ers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV), software (iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS), online services and distribution of digital content and applications (Digital Content and Services). Some of the Company\u2019s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company\u2019s offerings. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. The Company\u2019s business and \ufb01nancial performance could also be materially adversely a\ufb00ected depending on the time required to obtain su\ufb03cient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain su\ufb03cient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be a\ufb00ected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to signi\ufb01cant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A signi\ufb01cant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company\u2019s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely \ufb02ow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its o\ufb00erings through R&D, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. ", "The Company regularly \ufb01les patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. Many of the Company\u2019s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data During 2018, the Company\u2019s domestic and international net sales accounted for37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely a\ufb00ected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its \ufb01rst quarter compared to other quarters in its \ufb01scal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are \ufb01lled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be a\ufb00ected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company\u2019s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance. Warranty The Company o\ufb00ers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user. The Company also o\ufb00ers a 90-day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the Company\u2019s hardware products. In certain jurisdictions, local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute, typically at least two years. In addition, where available, consumers may purchase APP or AC+, which extends service coverage on many of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Backlog In the Company\u2019s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain su\ufb03cient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company\u2019s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Employees As of September 29, 2018, the Company had approximately 132,000 full-time equivalent employees. ", "Available Information The Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports \ufb01led pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), are \ufb01led with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).

Risk Factors The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. The business, \ufb01nancial condition and operating results of the Company can be a\ufb00ected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual \ufb01nancial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors a\ufb00ecting the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results, past \ufb01nancial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth . The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company\u2019s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including in\ufb02ation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tari\ufb00s, changes to \ufb01scal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency \ufb02uctuations could materially adversely a\ufb00ect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer con\ufb01dence and spending could be adversely a\ufb00ected in response to \ufb01nancial market volatility, negative \ufb01nancial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a signi\ufb01cant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other \ufb01nancial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and growth. Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company\u2019s products and services are o\ufb00ered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make signi\ufb01cant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a signi\ufb01cant number of patents and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. ", "The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signi\ufb01cant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Additionally, the Company faces signi\ufb01cant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to o\ufb00er solutions that are more competitive than those they currently o\ufb00er. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company\u2019s existing products. The Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have signi\ufb01cant resources and experience and have established service o\ufb00erings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, e\ufb00ectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the e\ufb00ective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or de\ufb01ciencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate e\ufb00ect of new product and service introductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone o\ufb00er \ufb01nancing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such o\ufb00ers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including sta\ufb03ng selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The \ufb01nancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products. ", "The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insu\ufb03cient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to signi\ufb01cant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and signi\ufb01cant commodity pricing \ufb02uctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may su\ufb00er from poor \ufb01nancial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain su\ufb03cient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The e\ufb00ects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and growth\u201d above, also could a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to signi\ufb01cant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be a\ufb00ected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. The Company\u2019s business and \ufb01nancial performance could also be materially adversely a\ufb00ected depending on the time required to obtain su\ufb03cient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A signi\ufb01cant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse e\ufb00ect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s \ufb02exibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for \ufb01nal assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or \ufb01nished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to \ufb01nal destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. ", "The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and \ufb01nished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe \ufb01nancial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted. The Company\u2019s products and services may be a\ufb00ected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company o\ufb00ers complex hardware and software products and services that can be a\ufb00ected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those o\ufb00ered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service o\ufb00erings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and \ufb01x all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it o\ufb00ers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues a\ufb00ecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modi\ufb01cations, write-o\ufb00s of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and signi\ufb01cant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory \ufb01nes. Quality problems could also adversely a\ufb00ect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to o\ufb00er their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may o\ufb00er competing products and services, and could take action to make it more di\ufb03cult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to o\ufb00er a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively a\ufb00ect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers. The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative bene\ufb01ts of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. ", "The Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices may suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatis\ufb01ed customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and o\ufb00er in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company\u2019s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemni\ufb01cation provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a signi\ufb01cant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plainti\ufb00s in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also signi\ufb01cantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemni\ufb01ed third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. Further, such an outcome could result in signi\ufb01cant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or pro\ufb01ts, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insu\ufb03cient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. ", "The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company is subject to laws and regulations a\ufb00ecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u2019s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u2019s network. These devices are also subject to certi\ufb01cation and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. These certi\ufb01cation processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modi\ufb01cations, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to the Company\u2019s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. The Company\u2019s business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s brand, international growth efforts and business. The Company also could be signi\ufb01cantly a\ufb00ected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected by international trade regulations, including duties, tari\ufb00s and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-pro\ufb01le venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse e\ufb00ect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. ", "Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve signi\ufb01cant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidenti\ufb01ed issues not discovered in the Company\u2019s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ine\ufb00ective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be su\ufb03cient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of con\ufb01dential information, including personally identi\ufb01able information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store con\ufb01dential information including, among other things, personally identi\ufb01able information (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes signi\ufb01cant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s business also requires it to share con\ufb01dential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure con\ufb01dential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always e\ufb00ective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of con\ufb01dential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the con\ufb01dentiality, integrity or availability of con\ufb01dential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to con\ufb01dential information, including PII, a\ufb00ect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be su\ufb03cient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach noti\ufb01cation requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. ", "Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur signi\ufb01cant fees or \ufb01nes if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a signi\ufb01cant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insu\ufb03cient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive O\ufb03cer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. The Company\u2019s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse e\ufb00ect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. International trade disputes could result in tari\ufb00s and other protectionist measures that could adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business. Tari\ufb00s could increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tari\ufb00s could also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to o\ufb00er its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative e\ufb00ect on consumer con\ufb01dence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Many of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by \ufb01re, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense e\ufb00ects. Such events could make it di\ufb03cult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and ine\ufb03ciencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service o\ufb00erings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience signi\ufb01cant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose signi\ufb01cant revenue. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption a\ufb00ecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. ", "The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely a\ufb00ected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers. The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. The Company\u2019s pro\ufb01t margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and con\ufb01guration changes, and component, warranty and other cost \ufb02uctuations. The Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company\u2019s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the introduction of new products, including new products with higher cost structures. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its \ufb01rst quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can signi\ufb01cantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could signi\ufb01cantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products, issues with new product introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume \ufb02uctuations that have a\ufb00ected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should re\ufb02ect expectations of future growth and pro\ufb01tability. The Company also believes its stock price should re\ufb02ect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speci\ufb01c number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, pro\ufb01tability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline signi\ufb01cantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor con\ufb01dence and employee retention. The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely a\ufb00ects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to o\ufb00set the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely a\ufb00ect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally bene\ufb01cial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the bene\ufb01t. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely a\ufb00ecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be e\ufb00ective to o\ufb00set any, or more than a portion, of the adverse \ufb01nancial e\ufb00ects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. ", "The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate \ufb02uctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may \ufb02uctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any signi\ufb01cant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future \ufb02uctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or \ufb01nancing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble \ufb01nal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 29, 2018, a signi\ufb01cant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to signi\ufb01cant change. The Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rates could be a\ufb00ected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with di\ufb00ering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Item 1B. None. Unresolved Staff Comments ", "Item 2. Properties The Company\u2019s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the Company owned 16.5 million square feet and leased 24.3 million square feet of building space, primarily in the U.S. Additionally, the Company owned a total of 7,376 acres of land, primarily in the U.S. As of September 29, 2018, the Company owned facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D and data centers at various locations throughout the U.S. Outside the U.S., the Company owned additional facilities and land for various purposes. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products and services. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. Refer to the risk factor \u201cThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights \u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results.

The remaining $71.0 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 29, 2018. The Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speci\ufb01c number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.

Gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year due primarily to higher product costs, partially o\ufb00set by a favorable shift in mix to Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on gross margin and gross margin percentage during 2017. The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the \ufb01rst quarter of2019 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company\u2019s expected gross margin percentage in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could di\ufb00er from actual results. The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to e\ufb00ectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs e\ufb00ectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company\u2019s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.

R&D expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in in headcount-related expenses, professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and infrastructure-related costs. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2018 Interest and dividend income $ Interest expense 2017 $ (3,240) Other expense, net Total other income/(expense), net Change 5,686 2,005 2016 $ (2,323) (441) $ Change 5,201 (133) (27)% $ 2,745 3,999 (1,456) (1,195) 104% $ 1,348 The year-over-year decrease in other income/(expense), net during 2018 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and the impact of foreign exchange\u2013 related items, partially o\ufb00set by higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange\u2013related items, partially o\ufb00set by higher interest expense on debt. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.16%, 1.99% and 1.73% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. ", "Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2018 Provision for income taxes Effective tax rate $ 2017 13,372 18.3% $ 2016 15,738 24.6% $ 15,685 25.6% On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which signi\ufb01cantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% e\ufb00ective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the \u201c2018 blended U.S. tax rate\u201d). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially o\ufb00set by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were lower than the historical statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate, partially o\ufb00set by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The lower e\ufb00ective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a di\ufb00erent geographic mix of earnings and higher U.S. R&D tax credits. As a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-09, Compensation \u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee ShareBased Payment Accounting (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), in 2018, the Company records any excess tax bene\ufb01ts or de\ufb01ciencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes. The Company anticipates that these excess tax bene\ufb01ts or de\ufb01ciencies will have the greatest impact on its e\ufb00ective tax rates in the \ufb01rst and third quarters, as the majority of the Company\u2019s equity awards vest in those quarters. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary di\ufb00erences, tax losses and tax credits of$6.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $426 million. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary di\ufb00erences, will be su\ufb03cient to recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance. On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of pro\ufb01ts of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion. Irish legislative changes, e\ufb00ective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. On July 24, 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the U.S. Tax Court's decision inAltera Corp v. Commissioner, regarding the inclusion of sharebased compensation in cost-sharing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries. The reversal was subsequently withdrawn, and the Company believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from the final resolution of the case. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, speci\ufb01es the presentation of the e\ufb00ects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ine\ufb00ectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its \ufb01rst quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. ", "Income Taxes In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its \ufb01rst quarter of 2019 utilizing the modi\ufb01ed retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company estimates recording $3 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), which modi\ufb01es lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modi\ufb01ed retrospective transition method through a cumulative-e\ufb00ect adjustment at the beginning of its \ufb01rst quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of September 29, 2018, the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $8.9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company\u2019s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments \u2013 Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of \ufb01nancial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its \ufb01rst quarter of 2019 utilizing the modi\ufb01ed retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modi\ufb01ed retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 and its related ASUs are collectively referred to herein as the \u201cnew revenue standard.\u201d The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative e\ufb00ect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standard in its \ufb01rst quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standard will not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. ", "Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected \ufb01nancial information and statistics as of and for the years endedSeptember 29, 2018, September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 237,100 $ 268,895 $ 237,585 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 41,304 $ 33,783 $ 27,010 Commercial paper $ 11,964 $ 11,977 $ 8,105 Total term debt $ 102,519 $ 103,703 $ 78,927 Working capital $ 14,473 $ 27,831 $ 27,863 Cash generated by operating activities (2) $ 77,434 $ 64,225 $ 66,231 Cash generated by/(used in) investing activities $ 16,066 $ (46,446) $ (45,977) Cash used in financing activities (2) $ (87,876) $ (17,974) $ (20,890) (1) As of September 29, 2018, total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $20.3 billion that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision and other agreements. (2) Refer to Note 1, \u201cSummary of Signi\ufb01cant Accounting Polices\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the prior period reclassification related to the Company\u2019s adoption of ASU 2016-09. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be su\ufb03cient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities. In connection with the State Aid Decision, as ofSeptember 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount of \u20ac13.1 billion plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company\u2019s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During 2018, cash generated by operating activities of $77.4 billion was a result of $59.5 billion of net income and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $34.7 billion, partially o\ufb00set by non-cash adjustments to net income of$16.8 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $16.1 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $32.4 billion, partially o\ufb00set by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $13.3 billion. Cash used in \ufb01nancing activities of $87.9 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $72.7 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of$13.7 billion and cash used to repay term debt of$6.5 billion, partially o\ufb00set by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $7.0 billion. During 2017, cash generated by operating activities of $64.2 billion was a result of $48.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $20.8 billion and a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $4.9 billion, which included a one-time payment of $1.9 billion related to a multi-year license agreement. Cash used in investing activities of $46.4 billion during 2017 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $33.1 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of$12.5 billion. Cash used in \ufb01nancing activities of $18.0 billion during 2017 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of$12.8 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of$28.7 billion and proceeds from commercial paper, net of $3.9 billion. Capital Assets The Company\u2019s capital expenditures were $16.7 billion during 2018. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $14.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2019, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of2.18% and maturities generally less than nine months. ", "As of September 29, 2018, the Company had outstanding \ufb02oating- and \ufb01xed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of$104.2 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d). During 2018, the Company issued $7.0 billion and repaid $6.5 billion of Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. Further information regarding the Company\u2019s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 2, \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d and Note 5, \u201cDebt.\u201d Capital Return Program During 2018, the Company repurchased 405.5 million shares of its common stock for $73.1 billion in connection with two separate share repurchase programs. Of the $73.1 billion, $44.0 billion was repurchased under the Company\u2019s previous share repurchase program of up to$210 billion, thereby completing that program. On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock. The remaining $29.0 billion repurchased during 2018 was in connection with the new share repurchase program. The Company\u2019s new share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speci\ufb01c number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. On May 1, 2018, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2018. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. The Company plans to use current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities to fund its share repurchase program and quarterly cash dividend. Contractual Obligations The following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 29, 2018, and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt and the deemed repatriation tax payable (in millions): Payments Due in 2019 Term debt $ 8,797 Payments Due in 2020\u20132021 $ 18,933 Payments Due in 2022\u20132023 $ 17,978 Payments Due After 2023 $ 58,485 Total $ 104,193 Operating leases 1,298 2,507 1,838 3,984 9,627 Manufacturing purchase obligations (1) 41,548 2,469 1,183 \u2014 45,200 Other purchase obligations 3,784 2,482 681 66 7,013 \u2014 5,366 5,942 22,281 33,589 Deemed repatriation tax payable Total $ 55,427 $ 31,757 $ 27,622 $ 84,816 $ 199,622 (1) Represents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, substantially all of which is noncancelable. Operating Leases The Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform \ufb01nal assembly and testing of \ufb01nished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Other Purchase Obligations The Company\u2019s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. ", "Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 29, 2018, a signi\ufb01cant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current Liabilities The Company\u2019s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemni\ufb01cation provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemni\ufb01ed third party. Except as disclosed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company o\ufb00ers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a speci\ufb01ed amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue. The Company has entered into indemni\ufb01cation agreements with its directors and executive o\ufb03cers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or o\ufb03cers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemni\ufb01cation claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and o\ufb03cers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insu\ufb03cient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of \ufb01nancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its \ufb01nancial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that a\ufb00ect the amounts reported in its consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Signi\ufb01cant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the signi\ufb01cant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated \ufb01nancial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. ", "Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is \ufb01xed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\u2019s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is \ufb01xed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-speci\ufb01c software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-speci\ufb01c objective evidence of fair value (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (\u201cTPE\u201d) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\u201cESP\u201d). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs re\ufb02ect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades to the device\u2019s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. The Company\u2019s process for determining ESPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights and non-software services o\ufb00ered, the estimated value of unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u2019s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u2019s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is o\ufb00ered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u2019s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u2019s estimates are based on historical experience and the speci\ufb01c terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results. ", "Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities The Company\u2019s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of availablefor-sale securities impact the Company\u2019s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by speci\ufb01c identi\ufb01cation of each security\u2019s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the \ufb01nancial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u2019s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities. In addition, the Company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory. The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. If the Company determines inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a write-down of the inventories. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. Any write-downs and/or impairments the Company may be required to record would adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results. Warranty Costs The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of speci\ufb01c product failures outside of the Company\u2019s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs di\ufb00er from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary di\ufb00erences between the \ufb01nancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in e\ufb00ect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes tax bene\ufb01ts from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax bene\ufb01ts recognized in the \ufb01nancial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ", "Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary di\ufb00erences, will be su\ufb03cient to recover the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves signi\ufb01cant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Act, which signi\ufb01cantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% e\ufb00ective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. This increase was composed of $2.0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially o\ufb00set by a $1.7 billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax bene\ufb01ts. Certain amounts reported by the Company related to the Act are provisional estimates in accordance with the SEC Sta\ufb00 Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Resolution of the Act\u2019s e\ufb00ects di\ufb00erent from the assumptions made by the Company could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signi\ufb01cant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the e\ufb00ective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will o\ufb00set more than a portion of the \ufb01nancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate \ufb02uctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to \ufb02uctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates a\ufb00ect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt. The Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. ", "As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company had outstanding \ufb02oating- and \ufb01xed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $102.5 billion and $103.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to e\ufb00ectively convert \ufb01xed-rate payments into \ufb02oating-rate payments or \ufb02oating-rate payments into \ufb01xed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally o\ufb00set by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 to increase by $399 million and $376 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Further details regarding the Company\u2019s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, \u201cDebt.\u201d Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with \ufb01nancial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain \ufb01rmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash \ufb02ows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially o\ufb00set the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013 denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of \ufb02uctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given con\ufb01dence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, \ufb01rm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% con\ufb01dence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of September 29, 2018 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as ofSeptember 30, 2017. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally o\ufb00set by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may di\ufb00er materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 29, 2018 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.

The Company\u2019s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of other accessory, service and support o\ufb00erings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, Book Store and Apple Music (collectively \u201cDigital Content and Services\u201d). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories, through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying consolidated \ufb01nancial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the consolidated \ufb01nancial statements re\ufb02ect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair \ufb01nancial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a\ufb00ect the amounts reported. Actual results could di\ufb00er materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassi\ufb01ed to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. The Company\u2019s \ufb01scal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\u2019s \ufb01scal years 2018 and 2016 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas \ufb01scal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the \ufb01rst \ufb01scal quarter of 2017, as is done every \ufb01ve or six years, to realign the Company\u2019s \ufb01scal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s \ufb01scal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is \ufb01xed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\u2019s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is \ufb01xed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-speci\ufb01c software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to thirdparty app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations. ", "The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspeci\ufb01ed and speci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Book Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools o\ufb00ered under the Company\u2019s standard limited warranty. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company\u2019s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is o\ufb00ered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u2019s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-speci\ufb01c objective evidence of fair value (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (\u201cTPE\u201d) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (\u201cESP\u201d). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs re\ufb02ect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry-speci\ufb01c software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered. For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades to the device\u2019s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The Company has identi\ufb01ed up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The \ufb01rst deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades relating to the product\u2019s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred. The Company\u2019s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar o\ufb00erings, productspecific business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product. Shipping Costs Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classi\ufb01ed as revenue, and the Company\u2019s shipping and handling costs are classi\ufb01ed as cost of sales. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. ", "Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 8, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d During the \ufb01rst quarter of 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (the \u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-09, Compensation \u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting(\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), which modi\ufb01ed certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classi\ufb01cation of awards and classi\ufb01cation in the statement of cash \ufb02ows. Historically, excess tax bene\ufb01ts or de\ufb01ciencies from the Company\u2019s equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and were classi\ufb01ed as a \ufb01nancing activity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Beginning in 2018, the Company records any excess tax bene\ufb01ts or de\ufb01ciencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which equity vesting occurs. The Company elected to apply the cash \ufb02ow classi\ufb01cation requirements related to excess tax bene\ufb01ts retrospectively to all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to cash generated by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of $627 million and $407 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The Company\u2019s marketable debt and equity securities have been classi\ufb01ed and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classi\ufb01es its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\u2019s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classi\ufb01ed as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are computed using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was$9.3 billion, $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2018, non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase to accounts payable and other current liabilities of$3.4 billion. ", "Fair Value Measurements The Company\u2019s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments and all other \ufb01nancial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using signi\ufb01cant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company\u2019s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years. The following tables show information about the Company\u2019s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions): 2018 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable securities $ 126,238 $ 60,599 $ 186,837 Unrealized losses $ (2,400) $ (1,889) $ (4,289) 2017 Continuous Unrealized Losses Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Fair value of marketable securities $ 101,986 $ 8,290 $ 110,276 Unrealized losses $ (596) $ (186) $ (782) ", "The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the \ufb01nancial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment\u2019s cost basis. As of September 29, 2018, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially o\ufb00set its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash \ufb02ows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash \ufb02ow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to o\ufb00set a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative \ufb01nancial instruments, such as its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may o\ufb00set a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash \ufb02ow or fair value hedges. As of September 29, 2018, the Company\u2019s hedged term debt\u2013 and marketable securities\u2013related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 24 years. The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to o\ufb00set a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from \ufb02uctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may o\ufb00set a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash \ufb02ow or fair value hedges. As of September 29, 2018, the Company\u2019s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 9 years. Cash Flow Hedges The e\ufb00ective portions of cash \ufb02ow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash \ufb02ow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash \ufb02ow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash \ufb02ow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash \ufb02ow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness. The ine\ufb00ective portions and amounts excluded from the e\ufb00ectiveness testing of cash \ufb02ow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash \ufb02ow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identi\ufb01ed time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassi\ufb01ed into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are re\ufb02ected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. ", "Net Investment Hedges The e\ufb00ective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ine\ufb00ective portions and amounts excluded from the e\ufb00ectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the \ufb01nancial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, during 2018, the Company recognized a gain of $20 million in net sales, a gain of $85 million in cost of sales and a loss of$198 million in other income/(expense), net. During 2017, the Company recognized a gain of $20 million in net sales, a loss of $40 million in cost of sales and a gain of $606 million in other income/(expense), net. The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company\u2019s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company\u2019s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions): 2018 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1): Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,015 $ 259 $ 1,274 Derivative liabilities (2): Foreign exchange contracts $ 543 $ 137 $ 680 Interest rate contracts $ 1,456 $ \u2014 $ 1,456 2017 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1): Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,049 $ 363 $ 1,412 Interest rate contracts $ 218 $ \u2014 $ 218 Derivative liabilities (2): Foreign exchange contracts $ 759 $ 501 $ 1,260 Interest rate contracts $ 303 $ \u2014 $ 303 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The credit risk amounts represent the Company\u2019s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above re\ufb02ects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments, it does not re\ufb02ect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these \ufb01nancial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. ", "The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain \ufb01nancial instruments \ufb02uctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 29, 2018, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion, which was recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2017, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was$35 million, which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, including the e\ufb00ects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative assets of $138 million and $32 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party \ufb01nancing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\ufb01nancing arrangements are directly between the third-party \ufb01nancing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for10%. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had two customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, each of which accounted for10%. The Company\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 59% of total trade receivables as of both September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble \ufb01nal products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for62% and 12%. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for42%, 19% and 10%.

The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% e\ufb00ective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. This increase was composed of $2.0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a $1.7 billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits. Deferred Tax Balances As a result of the Act, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse, including items for which the related income tax e\ufb00ects were originally recognized in OCI. In addition, the Company elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. Of the $2.0 billion recognized related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities, $1.2 billion is a provisional estimate that incorporates assumptions based upon the most recent interpretations of the Act and may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of additional implementation guidance. The Company\u2019s provisional estimates are in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Deemed Repatriation Tax As of September 30, 2017, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax liability of$36.4 billion for deferred foreign income. During 2018, the Company replaced $36.1 billion of its U.S. deferred tax liability with a deemed repatriation tax payable of $37.3 billion, which was based on the Company\u2019s cumulative post-1986 deferred foreign income. The deemed repatriation tax payable is a provisional estimate that may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of additional implementation guidance. The Company plans to pay the tax in installments in accordance with the Act. Adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 During the second quarter of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement \u2013 Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassi\ufb01cation of Certain Tax E\ufb00ects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cASU 2018-02\u201d). ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax e\ufb00ects of the Act on items within AOCI to retained earnings. The Company elected to apply the provision of ASU 2018-02 in 2018 with a reclassi\ufb01cation of net tax bene\ufb01ts related to cumulative foreign currency translation and unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments and marketable securities, resulting in a $278 million decrease in AOCI and a corresponding increase in retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Shareholders\u2019 Equity.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 29, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax bene\ufb01ts was$9.7 billion, of which $7.4 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rate. As of September 30, 2017, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax bene\ufb01ts was$8.4 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for2018, 2017 and 2016, is as follows (in millions): 2018 Beginning balances $ 2017 8,407 $ 2016 7,724 $ 6,900 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 2,431 333 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year (2,212) (952) (257) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 1,824 1,880 1,578 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (756) (539) (1,618) Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations \u2014 (39) Ending balances $ 9,694 $ 8,407 1,121 \u2014 $ 7,724 The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax bene\ufb01ts within the provision for income taxes. As ofSeptember 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was$1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Both the unrecognized tax bene\ufb01ts and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classi\ufb01ed as other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $236 million, $165 million and $295 million, respectively. ", "The Company is subject to taxation and \ufb01les income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006 in certain major U.S. states and subsequent to 2007 in certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax bene\ufb01ts could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $800 million. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of pro\ufb01ts of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion. Irish legislative changes, e\ufb00ective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of September 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency\u2013denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to e\ufb00ectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar\u2013denominated notes.

Note 6 \u2013 Shareholders\u2019 Equity Share Repurchase Program During 2018, the Company repurchased 405.5 million shares of its common stock for $73.1 billion in connection with two separate share repurchase programs. Of the $73.1 billion, $44.0 billion was repurchased under the Company\u2019s previous share repurchase program of up to$210 billion, thereby completing that program. On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company\u2019s common stock. The remaining $29.0 billion repurchased during 2018 was in connection with the new share repurchase program. The Company\u2019s new share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speci\ufb01c number of shares.

Note 8 \u2013 Benefit Plans 2014 Employee Stock Plan In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) and terminated the Company\u2019s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the \u201c2003 Plan\u201d). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive o\ufb03cers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on aone-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (\u201cDERs\u201d), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 29, 2018, approximately 280.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the \u201cDirector Plan\u201d) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company\u2019s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 29, 2018, approximately 1.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. ", "Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended September 29, 2018, Section 16 o\ufb03cers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip Schiller and Je\ufb00rey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company\u2019s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company\u2019s employee and director equity plans. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cPurchase Plan\u201d) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company\u2019s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee\u2019s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee\u2019s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, approximately 36.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 401(k) Plan The Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($18,500 for calendar year 2018). The Company matches50% to 100% of each employee\u2019s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum6% of the employee\u2019s eligible earnings. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity and related information for2018, 2017 and 2016, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Balance as of September 26, 2015 Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU 101,467 $ 85.77 RSUs granted 49,468 $ 109.28 RSUs vested (46,313) $ 84.44 RSUs canceled (5,533) $ 96.48 99,089 $ 97.54 RSUs granted 50,112 $ 121.65 RSUs vested (45,735) $ 95.48 RSUs canceled (5,895) $ 106.87 Balance as of September 24, 2016 Balance as of September 30, 2017 97,571 $ 110.33 RSUs granted 45,351 $ 162.86 RSUs vested (44,718) $ 111.24 RSUs canceled (6,049) $ 127.82 92,155 $ 134.60 Balance as of September 29, 2018 Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) $ 20,803 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $7.6 billion, $6.1 billion and $5.1 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees\u2019 obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 16.0 million, 15.4 million and 15.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\u2019s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees\u2019 tax obligations to taxing authorities were $2.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are re\ufb02ected as a \ufb01nancing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net share settlements had the e\ufb00ect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company. ", "Share-Based Compensation The following table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2018 Cost of sales $ Research and development $ 5,340 $ 769 2,299 1,662 $ 2016 877 2,668 Selling, general and administrative Total share-based compensation expense 2017 1,010 1,889 1,664 $ 4,840 1,552 $ 4,210 The income tax bene\ufb01t related to share-based compensation expense was $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of September 29, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was$9.4 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. Note 9 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Indemnification The following table shows changes in the Company\u2019s accrued warranties and related costs for2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2018 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ Cost of warranty claims $ (4,115) Accruals for product warranty Ending accrued warranty and related costs 2017 3,834 3,692 $ (4,322) 3,973 $ 2016 3,702 4,454 $ 3,834 4,780 (4,663) 3,585 $ 3,702 Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemni\ufb01cation provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemni\ufb01ed third party. Except as disclosed under the heading \u201cContingencies\u201d below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company o\ufb00ers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a speci\ufb01ed amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue. The Company has entered into indemni\ufb01cation agreements with its directors and executive o\ufb03cers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or o\ufb03cers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemni\ufb01cation claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and o\ufb03cers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insu\ufb03cient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. ", "The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. The Company\u2019s business and \ufb01nancial performance could also be materially adversely a\ufb00ected depending on the time required to obtain su\ufb03cient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain su\ufb03cient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be a\ufb00ected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to signi\ufb01cant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A signi\ufb01cant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company\u2019s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. Other Off\u2013Balance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other o\ufb00\u2013balance sheet \ufb01nancing arrangements. As of September 29, 2018, the Company\u2019s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.6 billion. The Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $939 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2018, are as follows (in millions): 2019 $ 1,298 2020 2021 1,289 1,218 2022 2023 Thereafter 1,038 800 3,984 Total $ 9,627 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain o\ufb00\u2013balance sheet arrangements which require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services and intellectual property licenses. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 29, 2018, are as follows (in millions): 2019 $ 2,447 2020 2021 3,202 1,749 2022 2023 Thereafter 1,596 268 66 Total $ 9,328 ", "Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. \ufb01led two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the \u201cEastern Texas District Court\u201d) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the \u201cVirnetX Patents\u201d) relating to network communications technology (\u201cVirnetX I\u201d and \u201cVirnetX II\u201d). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million, which later increased to $440 million in post-trial proceedings. VirnetX I is currently on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the \u201cFederal Circuit\u201d). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark O\ufb03ce (the \u201cPTO\u201d). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX has appealed, and those appeals are currently pending at the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit has consolidated the Company\u2019s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX\u2019s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits. Qualcomm On January 20, 2017, the Company \ufb01led a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and a\ufb03liated parties (\u201cQualcomm\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. As the Company does not believe the demanded royalty it has historically paid contract manufacturers for each applicable device is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and believes it to be invalid and/or overstated in other respects as well, no Qualcomm-related royalty payments have been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the case and has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of this matter. Note 10 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the \u201cmanagement\u201d approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\u2019s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Paci\ufb01c. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Paci\ufb01c includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \ufb01nancial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e\ufb00ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 5, 2018 ", "Item 9.

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \ufb01nancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive O\ufb03cer and Chief Financial O\ufb03cer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must re\ufb02ect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the bene\ufb01ts of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the e\ufb00ectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting (as de\ufb01ned in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
