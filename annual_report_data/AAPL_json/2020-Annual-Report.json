AirPods are the Company\u2019s wireless headphones that interact with Siri\u00ae . During 2020, the Company released AirPods Pro\u00ae . Apple Watch is the Company\u2019s line of smart watches based on its watchOS\u00ae operating system. In September 2020, the Company released Apple Watch Series 6 and a new Apple Watch SE. In October 2020, the Company announced HomePod mini\u2122, which is expected to be available in November 2020. Services Advertising The Company\u2019s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company\u2019s own advertising platforms. ", "AppleCare The Company o\ufb00ers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare\u00ae brand. The o\ufb00erings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. Cloud Services The Company\u2019s cloud services store and keep customers\u2019 content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. Digital Content The Company operates various platforms, including the App Store\u00ae , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.

Payment Services The Company offers payment services, including Apple Card\u2122, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay\u00ae , a cashless payment service. Markets and Distribution The Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2020, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 34% and 66%, respectively, of total net sales. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Competition The markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. ", "The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signi\ufb01cant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service o\ufb00erings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no pro\ufb01t or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify signi\ufb01cantly as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be a\ufb00ected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely \ufb02ow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly \ufb01les patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development and design, and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents, including utility patents, design patents and others. The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. ", "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its \ufb01rst quarter compared to other quarters in its \ufb01scal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signi\ufb01cantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are \ufb01lled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be a\ufb00ected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Employees As of September 26, 2020, the Company had approximately 147,000 full-time equivalent employees. Available Information The Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports \ufb01led pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), are \ufb01led with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).

Risk Factors The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. The business, \ufb01nancial condition and operating results of the Company can be a\ufb00ected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual \ufb01nancial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors a\ufb00ecting the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results, past \ufb01nancial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and stock price have been adversely a\ufb00ected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely a\ufb00ected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and stock price. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages that a\ufb00ected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic, the Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and \ufb01nancial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of e\ufb00ective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse e\ufb00ects on: demand for the Company\u2019s products and services; the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely a\ufb00ects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and stock price, it may also have the e\ufb00ect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company\u2019s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including in\ufb02ation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tari\ufb00s and other barriers to trade, changes to \ufb01scal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency \ufb02uctuations could materially adversely a\ufb00ect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer con\ufb01dence and spending could be adversely a\ufb00ected in response to \ufb01nancial market volatility, negative \ufb01nancial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. ", "In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a signi\ufb01cant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other \ufb01nancial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and growth. Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company\u2019s products and services are o\ufb00ered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make signi\ufb01cant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a signi\ufb01cant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. E\ufb00ective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signi\ufb01cant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no pro\ufb01t or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces signi\ufb01cant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to o\ufb00er solutions that are more competitive than those they currently o\ufb00er. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have signi\ufb01cant resources and experience and have established service o\ufb00erings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. ", "To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, e\ufb00ectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the e\ufb00ective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or de\ufb01ciencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate e\ufb00ect of new product and service introductions and transitions. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone o\ufb00er \ufb01nancing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such o\ufb00ers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including sta\ufb03ng selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The \ufb01nancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products. The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insu\ufb03cient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. ", "Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to signi\ufb01cant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and signi\ufb01cant commodity pricing \ufb02uctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may su\ufb00er from poor \ufb01nancial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain su\ufb03cient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The e\ufb00ects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201cGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and growth,\u201d above, also could a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to signi\ufb01cant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be a\ufb00ected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. The Company\u2019s business and \ufb01nancial performance could also be materially adversely a\ufb00ected depending on the time required to obtain su\ufb03cient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A signi\ufb01cant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse e\ufb00ect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s \ufb02exibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for \ufb01nal assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or \ufb01nished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to \ufb01nal destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and \ufb01nished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe \ufb01nancial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. ", "The Company\u2019s products and services may be a\ufb00ected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company o\ufb00ers complex hardware and software products and services that can be a\ufb00ected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those o\ufb00ered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service o\ufb00erings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and \ufb01x all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it o\ufb00ers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modi\ufb01cations, write-o\ufb00s of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and signi\ufb01cant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory \ufb01nes. Quality problems can also adversely a\ufb00ect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to o\ufb00er their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may o\ufb00er competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more di\ufb03cult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to o\ufb00er a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively a\ufb00ect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers. The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative bene\ufb01ts of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices may suffer. ", "The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatis\ufb01ed customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer o\ufb00ers purchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the Company\u2019s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been noti\ufb01ed that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemni\ufb01cation provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemni\ufb01ed third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a signi\ufb01cant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemni\ufb01ed third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. Further, such an outcome could result in signi\ufb01cant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or pro\ufb01ts, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require the Company to change its business practices or limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insu\ufb03cient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. ", "The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, \ufb01lm and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company\u2019s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to o\ufb00er a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the Company\u2019s business, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service o\ufb00erings, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or a\ufb00ecting the Company\u2019s business relationships with other technology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. Further, the Company\u2019s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against them, could a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely a\ufb00ected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. The Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-pro\ufb01le venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in signi\ufb01cant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse e\ufb00ect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve signi\ufb01cant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and signi\ufb01cant write-o\ufb00s. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any signi\ufb01cant investment could adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. ", "The Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ine\ufb00ective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be su\ufb03cient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of con\ufb01dential information, including personally identi\ufb01able information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store con\ufb01dential information including, among other things, personally identi\ufb01able information (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes signi\ufb01cant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s business also requires it to share con\ufb01dential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure con\ufb01dential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always e\ufb00ective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of con\ufb01dential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the con\ufb01dentiality, integrity or availability of con\ufb01dential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to con\ufb01dential information, including PII, a\ufb00ect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be su\ufb03cient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general con\ufb01dential information described above, the Company is also subject to speci\ufb01c obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach noti\ufb01cation requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur signi\ufb01cant fees or \ufb01nes if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a signi\ufb01cant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insu\ufb03cient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. ", "The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive O\ufb03cer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. The Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse e\ufb00ect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally bene\ufb01ts from growth in international trade. International trade disputes can result in tari\ufb00s, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tari\ufb00s being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tari\ufb00s may increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tari\ufb00s can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to o\ufb00er its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and stop o\ufb00ering third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to e\ufb00ectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a negative e\ufb00ect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Many of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by \ufb01re, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense e\ufb00ects. Such events could make it di\ufb03cult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and ine\ufb03ciencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service o\ufb00erings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience signi\ufb01cant expenditures to resume operations, and lose signi\ufb01cant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption a\ufb00ecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. ", "The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely a\ufb00ected, and could in the future adversely a\ufb00ect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company\u2019s pro\ufb01t margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary signi\ufb01cantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to e\ufb00ectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its \ufb01rst quarter compared to other quarters in its \ufb01scal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signi\ufb01cantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a signi\ufb01cant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could signi\ufb01cantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume \ufb02uctuations that have a\ufb00ected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should re\ufb02ect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speci\ufb01c number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, pro\ufb01tability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely a\ufb00ects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to o\ufb00set the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely a\ufb00ect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales. ", "Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally bene\ufb01cial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the bene\ufb01t. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely a\ufb00ecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be e\ufb00ective to o\ufb00set any, or more than a portion, of the adverse \ufb01nancial e\ufb00ects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate \ufb02uctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may \ufb02uctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any signi\ufb01cant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and nonmarketable securities, future \ufb02uctuations in their value could result in signi\ufb01cant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or \ufb01nancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a signi\ufb01cant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble \ufb01nal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2020, the Company\u2019s vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to signi\ufb01cant change. The Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rates could be a\ufb00ected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with di\ufb00ering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s e\ufb00ective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Company\u2019s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 26, 2020, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.

Fiscal Year Highlights COVID-19 Update COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has signi\ufb01cantly curtailed global economic activity and caused signi\ufb01cant volatility and disruption in global \ufb01nancial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely a\ufb00ected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During 2020, aspects of the Company\u2019s business were adversely a\ufb00ected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company\u2019s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its o\ufb03ces and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and \ufb01nancial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of e\ufb00ective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be su\ufb03cient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. Fiscal 2020 Highlights Total net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2020. In April 2020, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $175 billion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in May 2020. During 2020, the Company repurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion. On August 28, 2020, the Company e\ufb00ected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020.

Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $5.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.62% and maturities generally less than nine months. The Company may enter into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a speci\ufb01ed time and amount as an additional short-term liquidity arrangement.

Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. The Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual obligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of September 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of September 26, 2020. Further information regarding the Company\u2019s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \u201cLeases.\u201d Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform \ufb01nal assembly and testing of \ufb01nished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Other Purchase Obligations The Company\u2019s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. ", "Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 26, 2020, a signi\ufb01cant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. Other Non-Current Liabilities The Company\u2019s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of \ufb01nancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its \ufb01nancial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that a\ufb00ect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Signi\ufb01cant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the signi\ufb01cant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated \ufb01nancial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company has identi\ufb01ed up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The \ufb01rst performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company\u2019s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights o\ufb00ered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company\u2019s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees. ", "Warranty Costs The Company o\ufb00ers limited warranties on its new and certi\ufb01ed refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the Company\u2019s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of speci\ufb01c product failures outside the Company\u2019s typical experience. If actual product failure rates or repair costs di\ufb00er from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required. Income Taxes The Company recognizes tax bene\ufb01ts from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax bene\ufb01ts recognized in the \ufb01nancial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest bene\ufb01t that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves signi\ufb01cant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signi\ufb01cant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the e\ufb00ective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will o\ufb00set more than a portion of the \ufb01nancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate \ufb02uctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to \ufb02uctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates a\ufb00ect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt. The Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. ", "As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had outstanding \ufb02oating- and \ufb01xed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to e\ufb00ectively convert \ufb01xed-rate payments into \ufb02oating-rate payments or \ufb02oating-rate payments into \ufb01xed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally o\ufb00set by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 to increase by $218 million and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with \ufb01nancial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain \ufb01rmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash \ufb02ows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially o\ufb00set the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013 denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of \ufb02uctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given con\ufb01dence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, \ufb01rm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% con\ufb01dence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September 26, 2020, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September 28, 2019. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally o\ufb00set by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may di\ufb00er materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated \ufb01nancial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201cApple\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the consolidated \ufb01nancial statements re\ufb02ect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair \ufb01nancial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a\ufb00ect the amounts reported. Actual results could di\ufb00er materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. The Company\u2019s \ufb01scal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\u2019s \ufb01scal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the \ufb01rst \ufb01scal quarter every \ufb01ve or six years to realign the Company\u2019s \ufb01scal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s \ufb01scal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Common Stock Split On August 28, 2020, the Company e\ufb00ected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases At the beginning of the \ufb01rst quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (the \u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the \u201cnew leases standard\u201d), which modi\ufb01es lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new leases standard utilizing the modi\ufb01ed retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classi\ufb01cation, and (iii) initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion of right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Hedging At the beginning of the \ufb01rst quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-12,Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, speci\ufb01es the presentation of the e\ufb00ects of hedging instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ine\ufb00ectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modi\ufb01ed retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and a corresponding decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders\u2019 Equity. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d ", "Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2020 Numerator: Net income $ Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding Effect of dilutive securities Weighted-average diluted shares Basic earnings per share Diluted earnings per share 2019 57,411 $ 17,352,119 176,095 17,528,214 $ $ 3.31 3.28 2018 55,256 $ 18,471,336 124,315 18,595,651 $ $ 2.99 2.97 59,531 19,821,510 178,925 20,000,435 $ $ 3.00 2.98 The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive e\ufb00ect of potentially dilutive securities.Potentially dilutive securities representing 62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classi\ufb01ed and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classi\ufb01es its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\u2019s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d). The Company\u2019s investments in marketable equity securities are classi\ufb01ed based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company\u2019s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (\u201cOI&E\u201d). The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.7 billion, $11.3 billion and $9.3 billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $( 2.9) billion and $3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively. ", "Non-Marketable Securities The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E. Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current or non-current classi\ufb01cation based on the expected duration of the restriction. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classi\ufb01cation of the underlying securities. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Company\u2019s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments and all other \ufb01nancial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Note 2 \u2013 Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the signi\ufb01cant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that re\ufb02ect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identi\ufb01ed up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The \ufb01rst performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. ", "For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company\u2019s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had total deferred revenue of $10.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. As of September 26, 2020, the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year,25% within one-to-two years, 8% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions): 2020 iPhone (1) Mac (1) iPad (1) Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) Services (3) $ $ Total net sales (4) 137,781 28,622 23,724 30,620 53,768 274,515 2019 $ $ 142,381 25,740 21,280 24,482 46,291 260,174 2018 $ $ 164,888 25,198 18,380 17,381 39,748 265,595 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from the Company\u2019s advertising, AppleCare, digital content and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri, and free iCloud storage and Apple TV+ services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products.

", "The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company\u2019s non-current marketable debt securities generally range from one to five years. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the security is less than its cost, the \ufb01nancial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 26, 2020, the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company\u2019s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. Restricted Cash A reconciliation of the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions): 2020 Cash and cash equivalents Restricted cash included in other current assets Restricted cash included in other non-current assets $ Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2019 38,016 36 1,737 39,789 $ $ 48,844 23 1,357 50,224 The Company\u2019s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash to support the Company\u2019s iPhone Upgrade Program. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially o\ufb00set its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash \ufb02ows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash \ufb02ow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to o\ufb00set a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative \ufb01nancial instruments, such as its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may o\ufb00set a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash \ufb02ow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company\u2019s hedged term debt\u2013 and marketable securities\u2013related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years. The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to o\ufb00set a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. ", "To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from \ufb02uctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may o\ufb00set a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash \ufb02ow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company\u2019s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years. Cash Flow Hedges Cash \ufb02ow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash \ufb02ow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash \ufb02ow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash \ufb02ow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OI&E in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash \ufb02ow hedges, the time value is excluded from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness and recognized in the \ufb01nancial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Derivative instruments designated as cash \ufb02ow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identi\ufb01ed time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassi\ufb01ed into OI&E in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are re\ufb02ected in OI&E unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness are recognized in OCI. Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness and recognized in OI&E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Amounts excluded from the e\ufb00ectiveness assessment of fair value hedges and recognized in OI&E were gains of $465 million and $777 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the \ufb01nancial statement line item to which the derivative relates. The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company\u2019s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation.

The credit risk amounts represent the Company\u2019s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above re\ufb02ects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments, it does not re\ufb02ect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these \ufb01nancial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. ", "The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain \ufb01nancial instruments \ufb02uctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $875 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the potential e\ufb00ects of these rights of set-o\ufb00 associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, including the e\ufb00ects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $312 million and $407 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party \ufb01nancing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\ufb01nancing arrangements are directly between the third-party \ufb01nancing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of both September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. The Company\u2019s cellular network carriers accounted for 51% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2019. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble \ufb01nal products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for57% and 11%. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for59% and 14%.

The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% e\ufb00ective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014 remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $3.9 billion. ", "Interest and Penalties The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $85 million, $73 million and $489 million, respectively. European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of pro\ufb01ts of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, e\ufb00ective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.9 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency\u2013denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to e\ufb00ectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar\u2013denominated notes. As of September 28, 2019, a portion of the Company\u2019s Japanese yen\u2013denominated notes with a carrying value of $1.0 billion was designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company\u2019s net investment in a foreign operation. The Company\u2019s Japanese yen\u2013denominated notes matured during 2020 and the associated net investment hedges were terminated.

Note 9 \u2013 Benefit Plans 2014 Employee Stock Plan In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) and terminated the Company\u2019s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the \u201c2003 Plan\u201d). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive o\ufb03cers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on aone-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (\u201cDERs\u201d), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 1.54 billion shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 808 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the \u201cDirector Plan\u201d) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company\u2019s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. ", "Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 o\ufb03cers Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O\u2019Brien and Je\ufb00rey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that preestablishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company\u2019s stock, including shares acquired under the Company\u2019s employee and director equity plans. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cPurchase Plan\u201d) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company\u2019s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month o\ufb00ering periods. An employee\u2019s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee\u2019s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020, approximately107 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 401(k) Plan The Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($19,500 for calendar year 2020). The Company matches50% to 100% of each employee\u2019s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee\u2019s eligible earnings. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity and related information for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Balance as of September 30, 2017 RSUs granted RSUs vested RSUs canceled Balance as of September 29, 2018 RSUs granted RSUs vested RSUs canceled Balance as of September 28, 2019 RSUs granted RSUs vested RSUs canceled Balance as of September 26, 2020 390,284 181,402 (178,873) (24,195) 368,618 147,409 (168,350) (21,609) 326,068 156,800 (157,743) (14,347) 310,778 Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 27.58 40.72 27.81 31.95 33.65 53.99 33.80 40.71 42.30 59.20 40.29 48.07 $ 51.58 Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) $ 34,894 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $10.8 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.6 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees\u2019 obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 56 million, 59 million and 64 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\u2019s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees\u2019 tax obligations to taxing authorities were $ 3.9 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ", "Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax bene\ufb01t included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 Share-based compensation expense Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ $ 2019 6,829 $ (2,476) $ 2018 6,068 $ (1,967) $ 5,340 (1,893) As of September 26, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $12.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. Note 10 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Guarantees The following table shows changes in the Company\u2019s accrued warranties and related costs for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2020 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs Cost of warranty claims Accruals for product warranty Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ $ 2019 3,570 $ (2,956) 2,740 3,354 $ 2018 3,692 $ (3,857) 3,735 3,570 $ 3,834 (4,115) 3,973 3,692 The Company o\ufb00ers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and China mainland. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a speci\ufb01ed amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be a\ufb00ected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. ", "Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain o\ufb00\u2013balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 26, 2020, are as follows (in millions): 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total $ $ 3,476 2,885 1,700 357 104 130 8,652 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s \ufb01nancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a\ufb00ected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (\u201cVirnetX\u201d) \ufb01led a lawsuit against the Company alleging that certain of the Company\u2019s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which remanded the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, where it is scheduled for a re-trial in October 2020. The Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the re-trial at the U.S. Patent and Trademark O\ufb03ce (the \u201cPTO\u201d), and the PTO has declared the patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been \ufb01led in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company\u2019s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cNorthern California District Court\u201d). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U.S. federal and California state class actions. Under the terms of the settlement, which the Northern California District Court preliminarily approved in May 2020, the Company has agreed to pay up to $500 million in the aggregate to certain U.S. owners of iPhones if certain conditions are met. The \ufb01nal amount of the settlement will be determined based on the number of consumers who \ufb01le valid claims and the attorneys\u2019 fee award. However, the Company has agreed to pay at least $310 million to settle the claims. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers\u2019 user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. French Competition Authority On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced its decision that aspects of the Company\u2019s sales and distribution practices in France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of \u20ac1.1 billion. The Company strongly disagrees with the FCA\u2019s decision, and has appealed.

On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and awarded damages of $506 million. The Company has asked the court to set aside the verdict, where the case remains pending. Note 11 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the \u201cmanagement\u201d approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\u2019s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Paci\ufb01c. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Paci\ufb01c includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

Note 12 \u2013 Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.The Company\u2019s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. Payments under the Company\u2019s lease arrangements may be \ufb01xed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with \ufb01xed payments on the Company\u2019s operating leases were $1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company\u2019s leases were $9.3 billion for 2020. Rent expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease accounting standards, was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. For 2020, the Company made $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.

The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company\u2019s leases cannot be readily determined. As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $1.7 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced.

In our opinion, the \ufb01nancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the \ufb01nancial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash \ufb02ows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting \ufb01rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \ufb01nancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the \ufb01nancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \ufb01nancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signi\ufb01cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the \ufb01nancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the \ufb01nancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \ufb01nancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the \ufb01nancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the \ufb01nancial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and \ufb01les income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.\u2019s effective tax rate. Apple Inc. uses signi\ufb01cant judgment in the calculation of tax liabilities in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of technical merits and complex tax laws. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the bene\ufb01t of various tax positions can be complex, involves signi\ufb01cant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. ", "How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel con\ufb01rmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.\u2019s auditor since 2009.

In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash \ufb02ows for each of the three years in the period ended September 26, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated October 29, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting \ufb01rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating e\ufb00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \ufb01nancial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e\ufb00ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 29, 2020 Apple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 61 ", "Item 9.

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \ufb01nancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive O\ufb03cer and Chief Financial O\ufb03cer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must re\ufb02ect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the bene\ufb01ts of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the e\ufb00ectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting (as de\ufb01ned in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the e\ufb00ectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over \ufb01nancial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
